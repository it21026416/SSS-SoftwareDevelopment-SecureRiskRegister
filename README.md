# Secure Risk Register Web Application 
This is a Risk Register Web Application developed using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The application allows users to manage and track risks within their organization.
# Features
User authentication: The application provides a login system to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage the risk register.
Risk creation and management: Users can create, update, and delete risks in the register. Each risk can have attributes such as a title, description, impact, likelihood, and risk level.
Search and filtering: Users can search for specific risks based on various criteria, such as title, risk level, or date of creation.
Dashboard: The application provides a dashboard that displays an overview of the risks, including the total number of risks, the distribution of risks by level, and the top risks by impact and likelihood.
Responsive design: The web application is built with responsive design principles, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across different devices and screen sizes.
